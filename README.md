## Name
Weather Application

## Description
This weather application allows a user to search any location within the United States and get current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast for that location. Once a location is searched, the program then add a button of that location to the previously searched list. This button can then be clicked at any time to return to the weather search results for that location.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

## Usage
In order to use this application, the user only needs to enter the name of a town or city in the first search box and the two letter abbreviation of the state in the second search box and click search. The program then uses the Open Weather API to find that locations latitude and longitude coordinates which then plug into a current weather search and a 5-day weather search. Once this search has been completed, the program then displays these results for the user to see.
